On June 17, 2025, my GitHub account was blocked from submitting compiler bug reports to the official `facebook/react` repository, despite being an original builder of the experimental React 19.1+ lineage.

All related work â€” including closure serializer tests, `use:` directive prototypes, and `babel-plugin-react-compiler` infrastructure â€” will now continue publicly in this fork for transparency.
